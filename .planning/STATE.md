# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-05)

**Core value:** Every Blitz employee gets an intelligent, context-aware assistant that automates their daily work routines and lets them build custom automations without writing code — all within an enterprise-secure, on-premise environment where data never leaves the company.
**Current focus:** v1.3 Phase 15 — Session & Auth Hardening (ready to plan)

## Current Position

Phase: 15 of 23 (Session & Auth Hardening)
Plan: —
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-05 — Roadmap created for v1.3 (9 phases, 53 requirements)

- Total plans completed: 54 (across 3 milestones, 18 phases)
- Total timeline: 9 days (2026-02-24 to 2026-03-04)
- Tests: 719 passing (at v1.2 ship)

**v1.3:**
- Plans completed: 0
- Phases: 9 (15-23)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
v1.2 decisions archived to `.planning/milestones/v1.2-ROADMAP.md`.

v1.3 roadmap decisions:
- [roadmap]: Two-track structure — foundations (15-18) then skill platform (19-23)
- [roadmap]: Phase 17 (performance) architecturally independent of Phase 16 — can parallelize if needed
- [roadmap]: Phase 21 (security hardening) depends on both Phase 19 and Phase 20

### Pending Todos

- [ ] Start WhatsApp Business API verification process (takes 1-4 weeks, needed for future live testing)
- [ ] Add CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY to production .env before OAuth flows (deferred to v1.4)
- [ ] [POST-MVP] HashiCorp Vault for secret management

### Blockers/Concerns

- CVE-2025-29927: Next.js must be confirmed at 15.2.3+ before any middleware.ts is written (Phase 15)
- Embedding sidecar dual-load risk: FlagEmbedding removal must be atomic with sidecar addition (Phase 17)
- Keycloak optional boot: config.py validation must handle missing keycloak_url gracefully (Phase 18)
